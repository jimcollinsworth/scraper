                "Victim": "Brittany Sue Zimmermann, age 21, Marshfield WI (Ms. Zimmermann was currently living in Madison at the West Doty Street Address while she attended UW-Madison)",
                "Details": "BRITTANY ZIMMERMANN SCHOLARSHIP FUND (posted Wed. April 16th)\r\n\r\n-In the wake of her tragic death, the family of Brittany Zimmermann has announced that they are establishing a scholarship in Brittany's name and conducting a fund drive called \"Dollars for Brittany\".  A Marshfield credit union is facilitating the collection of funds.  \r\n\r\nContributions can be sent to:\r\n\r\nBrittany Zimmermann Memorial Fund\r\nC/O Marshfield Medical Center CU\r\nPO Box 279\r\nMarshfield, WI 54449\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(UPDATED Monday, April 14, 2008)\r\n\r\nThe Madison Police Department is seeking additional information from people who were in the Bassett Neighborhood either on the day Brittany was killed, or on the day before her death. Specifically, detectives would like to speak with anyone who was solicited for money \u2013 or gave money to strangers - on either April 1st or April 2nd.  This would include citizens who were approached on the street, or at their homes, by one or more individuals. Investigators are focusing this effort on solicitations that were made on West Washington Ave., West Main St., West Wilson St., South Bedford St., South Bassett St., or West Doty Street.  The MPD would ask those with information to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.\r\n\r\n\r\n(UPDATED FRIDAY APRIL 11, 2008)\r\n\r\nPosters seeking information in the Brittany Sue Zimmermann case will soon be posted by Madison Police Officers in the Bassett Neighborhood, and in other areas of the central city. A copy of the poster has been attached to this incident report. \r\n\r\nMadison Crime Stoppers has now received approximately 200 tips in the Zimmermann case. In addition, some 25 new tips have come in reference the Joel Marino homicide. Joel was murdered on January 28th, and prior to Brittany\u2019s homicide around 70 tips had been received in the Marino investigation.\r\n\r\nThere are some similarities in the cases. Both residents were killed inside their homes, during daylight hours, and no motive has been established in either case. There appears to be nothing in either victim\u2019s background that would make them targets of violence. \r\n\r\nStill, investigators do not know if the cases are connected, and there are differences. For example, in the Zimmermann case there were signs of forced entry. There was no evidence of forced entry in the Marino case. \r\n\r\nBoth Marino and Zimmermann lived in close proximity, perhaps a mile or so apart. Because of the closeness detectives working the Marino case are coming across information that may help the Zimmermann case. Conversely, detectives working the Zimmermann case are coming across information that may aid the Marino probe.\r\n\r\nBoth cases remain very active investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(UPDATED MONDAY APRIL 7)\r\n\r\nSome members of the media have been inquiring about a man who was going to various locations in the downtown (including a residence on West Washington Avenue) soliciting money from residents on the day of Brittany's death. This person is in custody on a probation hold, and is one of many who have been arrested (for things like probation holds and unrelated crimes) during the Zimmermann investigation. No suspect has been identified in the murder of Brittany. Detectives are continuing to pursue a plethora of leads. The MPD appreciates all of those who have come forward with information, and encourages others to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 as this remains a very active investigation. \r\n\r\n(UPDATED PRESS INFORMATION: RELEASED FRIDAY APRIL 4, 2008)\r\n\r\nThe Madison Police Department, with assistance from the WI State Crime Laboratory, continued Friday to process the home of Brittany Sue Zimmermann. \r\n\r\nForensic analysts at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison are already expediting the examination of some items found that may have evidentiary value.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the focus of the investigation continues on several fronts. Patrol officers and detectives have been talking with numerous people in the neighborhood including residents, commuters, business owners, and transients.   Police are seeking to speak with those who are willing to share information, and those who may be somewhat reluctant to contact police directly.   Police seek any information regarding activity in the area.   \r\n\r\nIn the Zimmermann case, the MPD would like citizens to focus on the daytime \u2013 going into the nighttime hours -- of Wednesday April 2nd.   If anyone saw anything odd, strange, or out of the ordinary in the area of the crime scene\u2014a call to Crime Stoppers (608-266-6014) would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nIn the last 24 hours more than 75 tips have come in to Crime Stoppers. Many of those calls are from people who have had strangers come to their doors, or into their homes recently, or over the course of the past several months. Several callers said at the time they did not call police. The MPD would urge anyone, at anytime, encountering a similar situation to call. \r\n\r\nOther tips in the Zimmermann investigation have come from downtown residents who saw people going door to door asking for money on the day of the homicide. In at least one case a man entered a residence. Investigators have identified many of these people, and have talked with them. It is not unusual during such contacts that arrests are made for unrelated matters. For instance, some contacts are made with those who may have outstanding warrants, or are wanted on probation holds.\r\n\r\nAt this hour the MPD does not have a suspect, or suspects identified in the Zimmermann homicide.  The Dane County Coroner has determined Brittany died from a \u201ccomplexity of traumatic injuries.\u201d  Investigators have not established a motive. \r\n\r\nMadison and UW police officers will continue increased foot patrols in the Bassett Street Neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(UPDATED THURSDAY APRIL 3 @ 12:20 p.m.)\r\n\r\nInvestigators in the Brittany Zimmermann homicide have concluded that her boyfriend is not a suspect in this case. \r\n\r\nHe has been -- and continues to be -- very helpful in providing information to the detective team.\r\n\r\nMany leads have come in, and detectives are pursuing them. No suspect has been identified.\r\n\r\nThe search of Brittany's home -- and the area around it -- continues.  Items of possible evidentiary value are being taken to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison for analysis.\r\n\r\nA member of the Dane County's Victim/Witness unit is working with Brittany's family. She will be keeping them posted on developments in the case, and has informed the MPD that the family is asking for privacy as they continue to grieve.\r\n\r\nA good number of tips have come in to the MPD, and citizens with any information that may help lead to an arrest are encouraged to continue to call the Madison Police Crime Stoppers line at 608-266-6014.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n(ORIGINAL RELEASE)\r\nShortly after 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday Madison Police were called to a residence in the 500 block of West Doty Street to check on a person. Ms. Zimmermann was found dead inside her home. Dane County Coroner John Stanley says a preliminary examination indicates the manner of death was homicide. \r\n\r\nThe Madison Police Department is working in unison with the UW-Madison Police Department on this case, and a Command Post has been established inside the Central District station.\r\n\r\nBoth Madison Police Chief Noble Wray, and UW Police Chief Susan Riseling have pledged extra patrols, and a heightened presence on Doty Street and surrounding areas for the time being.\r\n\r\nAt this writing no suspects have been identified, and detectives have been unable to rule out that this may have been a random act.\r\n\r\nDistrict Alderman Mike Verveer is looking to hold a community meeting this weekend to address concerns of residents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a team of detectives will work the case around the clock, with patrol officers aiding in their efforts.\r\n\r\nCoroner Stanley has indicated a forensic examination will be done tomorrow morning at which time he may (or may not -- depending on consultation with investigators) release more information on the cause of death.\r\n\r\n\"This terrible crime is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victim's family and friends,\" said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. \"I am going to work closely with the Madison Police Department and other law enforcement authorities to provide the resources necessary to bring the perpetrator to justice and address the public safety needs of the community",

Officers learned a garage door was accidently left open, and that an intruder stole two sets of keys, and a laptop computer. The van had been parked in the driveway, behind a 2016 Mazda CX that had been in the garage. The criminals apparently did not want the minivan. They pulled it out, leaving it in the roadway, so they could take the Mazda.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

The car had been stolen on December 6th after its owner left it running, and warming up, in front of his Westover Court home.

The burglar made a quick exit with the victim following close behind, asking for his laptop back. After an initial denial of its possession, the burglar pulled the stolen property out from his jacket where it had been concealed. The victim attempted to stall the stranger as he called for police, but the suspect was able to get away. However, the victim provided an excellent description of the intruder and a MPD officer was soon in a foot pursuit. The suspect was dashing down a S. Broom St. alleyway where he made a hop over a snowbank. This did not go well for him as he immediately slipped and fell providing the MPD a position of advantage. The officer immediately recognized the suspect. <a href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=23880\" target=\"_blank\">David M. Ndong</a>, age 27, Madison, has <a href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=23710\" target=\"_blank\">been arrested</a> numerous times by <a href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/police/newsroom/incidentreports/incident.cfm?id=24203\" target=\"_blank\">Central District</a> officers. At the time of his latest apprehension, he was in possession of several cell phones, as well as credit and debit cards that do not belong to him. An investigation into crimes connected to those items is ongoing. For now, Ndong is back in jail for burglary, theft, resisting/obstructing, bail jumping and a probation violation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

They kept a close eye on her for over an hour, but did not want to too close for fear of spooking Anika again.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, father and daughter were with the officers: dad still clad in his hospital pajamas and slippers. All worked in concert to get Anika back on a leash.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming off surgery, having a man\u2019s best friend back to help&nbsp;with recuperation was very much appreciated. So much so, the owner offered the officers a handsome reward: Green Bay Packers tickets.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepting gratuities is not something they can do, but just being part of a good deed, putting smiles on faces, restored the officers\u2019 belief that humanity and hope are still present even during times when so much seems so uncertain.",

Officers searched the victim\u2019s vehicle and did not find a knife. The suspect, Joseph B. Mandt, age 36, Belleville, had two handguns in his truck.

She had also just called 911 following a road-rage incident that made her \u201cscared for my life.\u201d The victim said the driver of a SUV began following her on Gilman St. She says he next sped past her, cut her off, and got out of his vehicle. She says he had something in his hand, which she feared might be a gun, and yelled at her and her passenger. The victim provided a good description of the SUV, and officers soon pulled it over, making a high-risk traffic stop on Sixth St. No weapon was found, and the driver, Jamarious M. Shoulders, age 23, Madison, was arrested for disorderly conduct and a probation violation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

One subject fired multiple shots in the air from a handgun, and two individuals were attacked and struck with a crowbar. Individuals were also observed attempting to light Molotov cocktails during the evening. Officers in protective gear deployed to State Street as a result of this behavior.&nbsp; Multiple officers were struck with rocks and projectiles as they moved to secure the street.&nbsp; Chemical agents were utilized in response.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor the third straight night, a number of individuals have come downtown not for the purpose of First Amendment expression, but to engage in violence, looting and property damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;15 arrests were made during the night.&nbsp; MPD is grateful to the many outside law enforcement agencies and National Guard personnel who assisted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMPD also responded to a number of looting incidents elsewhere in the City.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNote/clarification:&nbsp; MPD has received several media questions in recent days about the use of \u201crubber bullets.\u201d&nbsp; MPD does not use and has not deployed \u201crubber bullets.\u201d&nbsp; However, MPD personnel have deployed a handful of less lethal sponge rounds over the course of the unrest Saturday and Sunday.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

                "Details": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was unexpected, but yet an oh-so welcome peace offering, considering these turbulent and divisive times, and it came from an organizer of last night\u2019s protest.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A MPD Special Events Team (SET) was away from the gathering on State Capitol grounds, giving people space to exercise their First Amendment rights. The team was ready to deploy to State Street, should looting and other violence erupt again. The following is an account from one of its members:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201cWe formed a line in front of Grace Episcopal Church, when we were approached by three protesters. As I recall, two were black men, and one was a black woman. The woman informed SET that the peaceful protest was over, and she was leaving. She went on to tell us that she would go down to the top of State Street, encourage the group to leave, and inform them that the protest was over. The woman made clear that whoever remained would know that their decision could carry a consequence. The woman then&nbsp;headed down to the top of State Street, and I could hear&nbsp;her voice in what I understood to be an attempt to speak with the group. The woman returned back to our position, and she wished SET a safe night.&nbsp;Her group also handed out flowers to SET officers, and I do not know an officer who turned the offer down. Many officers carried the flowers on them during the subsequent clear of State Street (after looting broke out).<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this week has been extremely challenging for so many. I thought it was incredibly brave for these three individuals to approach the police, and offer a gesture of kindness. This demonstrated to me what almost all of us recognize - many of those in the crowd wish to lawfully&nbsp;express their constitutional liberties, and only a small group of people are causing the chaos we have seen. SET is absolutely committed to protecting lawful protest, and this commitment is why I joined the team.&nbsp;Unfortunately, SET's responsibilities to public safety limit our ability&nbsp;to engage in a&nbsp;conversation about what is happening&nbsp;while in hard gear, but many SET officers noted how remarkable and kind this moment was.\u201d<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story will likely not make headline news, but for those looking for glimmers of hope, they are out there, on our streets: in this case protesters and police sharing moments of humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

It is egg laying time, and the hunt for new habitat is instinctual, yet often times dangerous.<br />\r\nSuch was the case last Tuesday night on Industrial Drive. By the time an officer arrived, it appeared a slow moving snapping turtle, which was in the roadway, had just escaped certain death. Its shell was freshly scraped, and it appeared a passing car\u2019s undercarriage had caused damage, but no serious injury.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer attempted to encourage the turtle\u2019s forward progress by pushing it with a police baton. However, snapping turtles are known for having rather combative dispositions, and true to form, this one responded by looking at the officer while repeatedly opening and shutting its powerful beak-like jaws.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201cThe turtle was also very heavy to just push,\u201d noted the officer. She next attempted to get it on top of a plastic sheet, with thoughts of pulling it across rain-slicked pavement. \u201cHowever the turtle\u2019s claws were very sharp and ripped up the plastic sheet,\u201d said the officer. It was time for backup: \u201cI do not have experience with moving a large snapping turtle, so I requested assistance.\u201d<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for an officer with a more extensive wildlife background, \u201cI tried to use verbal commands to get the turtle to move across the road. However, the turtle continued to assess me as a threat and kept trying to snap/bite in my direction.\u201d<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the second officer arrived, he explained you need to move a snapping turtle by lifting it with two hands, just above the rear legs, but not by the turtle\u2019s tail as that can cause spinal damage.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, the hoist was made. The turtle was now making rapid progress on its journey, yet continued to show displeasure with human contact.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been unwanted, but the initial officer was very pleased with the outcome of the safe passage, writing in her report: \u201cHopefully the turtle will continue to live a long snappy life.\u201d<br />\r\nShe decided to name it for its behavior and home turf: \u201cSnappy the South Side Turtle\u201d<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

He said he was then sucker punched. He fell to the ground and was battered by several people.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A media member, who witnessed the assault, told police approximately ten people punched and kicked the politician while he was on the ground and as the politician tried to explain that he is an ally.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the beating stopped, the politician tried to dialogue with his attackers, explaining who he was, and asking for his phone and glasses to be returned. They were, and someone identifying herself as a nurse came to his aid.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling \u201clightheaded, stunned and dazed\u201d he next stumbled toward the State Capitol, where he laid down on the grass.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made contact with Capitol Police who called for an emergency medical response.

Wilson St \u2013 were \u201cracist.\u201d The 60-year-old man, who lives in the neighborhood, had originally yelled at artists from his SUV. This promoted one woman, who was painting murals on plywood coverings, to call the MPD\u2019s non-emergency line saying the man was not making threats, but was he harassing artists. The 22-year-old called again, this time to 911, after the man approached the artists, on foot, wanting to know where they lived. She said he made no physical threats, and she saw no weapons. However, another artist said the man had threatened to cover up their work. The officer contacted the man, who was holding a pen and pad of paper. He said he wanted to get the artists names so he could give them to police. The officer told the man the artists were not committing any crimes, and that it would be best for him to depart. He did. The officer told the artists it appears communications - coming from them, and from the man - are protected by the First Amendment. The officer wished the artists well.

Thompson was taken into custody for robbery with use of force, substantial battery, strangulation and disorderly conduct for the robbery.

He says the suspect grabbed him from behind, by the neck, and pulled him backwards. He tried to yell, but nothing came out. He could not breathe. The victim says he was punched and kicked multiple times before being knocked unconscious after the suspect lifted him up, above the suspect\u2019s head, and threw the victim to the concrete pavement. When the robbery was over, the victim said his cash and cell phone were gone.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the assault, a 21-year-old bar employee was outside his workplace when the suspect allegedly punched him twice in the face.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Peace Park victim was taken to a hospital with many non-life-threatening injuries. The bar employee suffered facial cuts, and was seen by Madison Fire Department paramedics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

The suspects took off running. MPD officers, with help from Town of Madison police, and a Dane County deputy, were able to chase down two, the car\u2019s passengers: a 21-year-old man, and a 16-year-old boy. The older suspect was experiencing a medical condition and was taken to a hospital. The 16-year-old was arrested on several outstanding tentative charges as well as resisting, bail jumping, and being a passenger in a stolen car. The 21-year-old will face similar tentative charges when booked into the Dane County Jail. The car\u2019s driver is also 16. He too is someone police were already seeking as he is a suspect in recent offenses. The teen has a past criminal history that includes burglaries, thefts from autos, and credit card frauds. The Audi was stolen early yesterday morning from the parking lot of Kwik Trip, 3153 Maple Grove Dr. Its owner had left it unlocked, with the key fob inside, as he went in to get a cup of coffee.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

                "Details": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Madison nurse got her stolen bike back, and a bike thief went to jail, all thanks to one of the victim\u2019s Clark Court neighbors. Yesterday he spotted a suspect checking doors of parked cars in the area, and then watched as the same man swiped the nurse\u2019s $700 Trek road bike off of her porch. The neighbor, and the nurse, reported all of this to an officer who was called to the scene.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several hours later, just before noon, the neighbor was calling 911 again. He was now at Brittingham Park and, lo and behold, there was the suspect sitting on a bench with the nurse\u2019s bike right next to it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an officer arrived, the suspect provided a fake name, and said he had just gotten to Madison 15 days prior from Havana, Cuba via the Chicago Area. The bike, he said, he bought from a guy for ten bucks.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately for him, there was an eyewitness, the nurse\u2019s neighbor, and the suspect was soon on his way to jail, where he was actually booked in for stealing two bikes.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A downtown MPD officer was able to connect Jose A. Lino, age 56, to an earlier theft thanks to surveillance cameras. They had captured Lino taking a 23-year-old man\u2019s bicycle just after midnight on August 24th. The victim had locked it to a rack in the 100 block of State St.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer interviewed Lino at the jail, and Lino admitted to stealing the State St. bike. He said it was now gone. He sold it for ten bucks.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 23-year-old was out of luck, but not the nurse. With her blessing, police gave her bike to her alert neighbor who brought it back to her just hours after it was stolen.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

He left, smoked some, and concluded it was \u201ccrap.\u201d He wanted his money back. Trouble was, the victim assured he had not sold cocaine to this man, ever.

                "Details": "&nbsp;A 20-year-old DeForest woman was pumping gas last week, and when she finished she realized someone had swiped her wallet. She had left her Tory Burch wristlet in a cup holder. The victim recalled seeing a car, filled with young men wearing masks, pull through the pump area while she was filling up. Surveillance video indicates one got out, sneaked up to the victim\u2019s unlocked passenger door, opened it, and took the wallet. The car, occupied by the suspects, is listed as stolen out of Sun Prairie. The theft took place in the early morning hours of September 28th at the Kwik Trip, 7502 Mineral Point Rd. MPD crime analysts indicate this brings to four the number of recent similar thefts at area gas stations. Motorists are urged to lock doors, and roll up windows, while pumping gas. It is also a good idea to take your purse or wallet with you, or at least keep them out of sight.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

                "Details": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For early October, the weather could not have been finer for an afternoon downtown run. A N. Frances St. resident, a 20-year-old, certainly thought so. Sadly, stretching his legs came with a price. He had not locked his backdoor, and when he arrived home, his wallet was gone.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, thanks to the wonderful world of technology, he was able to determine, using his cell phone, that someone was actively using his credit card to purchases, not far away, at Walgreens, 676 State St.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim ventured there, and stood behind the suspect in line, watching as he used the victim\u2019s stolen credit card to buy multiple packs of cigarettes. The 20-year-old did not engage the suspect, wanting to stay safe, but did watch as the man headed outside, handing out packs of smokes to friends.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man continued to follow the suspect, but lost him as he called police.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An officer went to the Walgreens seeking clues. Because the man had purchased cigarettes, he was required to provide a photo ID, and his image was captured on surveillance cameras.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer went back outside, and soon spotted the suspect in the 500 block of State Street. Ronald Watson, age 56, Madison, told the officer he had made some purchases at Walgreens, but &nbsp;did so with a credit card given to him by a guy known downtown as \u201cShorty.\u201d<br />\r\n\u201cShorty,\u201d said the suspect, is not allowed in Walgreens, and asked for assistance in buying some items. The officer said the story was not making sense, since Watson was still holding a Walgreens bag containing packs of cigarettes.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer also used other surveillance cameras to track Watson to places very near the victim\u2019s apartment, right around the time of the burglary.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watson was arrested for misappropriation of personal identifying materials and felony bail jumping.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central District officers are aware of an individual who goes by the moniker, \u201cShorty.\u201d They located and talked with \u201cShorty,\u201d and \u201cShorty\u201d said he had nothing to do with any of what Watson was talking about.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like another great day for a run, but whether you live downtown or elsewhere, the MPD recommends you lock your doors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

The victim could see he seemed preoccupied, and was on his phone, so she honked. He still did not move. So she honked some more. Just as the light was turning yellow, he finally accelerated. She also made it through the intersection, and pulled up to the pumps. That\u2019s when she saw the man. He was now parked nearby, not getting gas, but staring at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem,\u201d she asked. That\u2019s when he got out, and walked her way while pointing a handgun. He made several statements, including, \u201cI will end you.\u201d The victim, who was now very frightened, said nothing further, and after several seconds, the man got back in his car and drove away.

Based on her statement, MPD developed probable cause to arrest the man \u2013 a felon with a lengthy criminal history - for second degree reckless endangerment with a domestic enhancer, possession of firearm by felon, false imprisonment, disorderly conduct, and felony bail jumping. Officers attempted to negotiate with the suspect from outside the residence. While this was taking place, officers and concerned neighbors heard two gunshots coming from inside the condo. A robot equipped with a camera was used to enter, and officers could see the suspect was unresponsive with a handgun visible next to him. &nbsp;Officers entered and determined that the suspect was deceased from a self-inflicted injury. The Dane County Medical Examiner will make an official determination on the cause and manner of death, and decide whether the deceased man\u2019s name is publically released.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

                "Details": "Several Madison teens were able to get out of a crashed stolen car shortly before it was engulfed in flames Tuesday afternoon. Witnesses told investigating officers the 2020 Hyundai Elantra, listed as stolen out of McFarland, was traveling at an estimated 90 to 100 mph when the driver blew through the intersection of Femrite Dr. and Agriculture Dr. The witness said the Hyundai went \u201cflying\u201d into the air. When it landed, the driver lost control and took out a traffic sign, which catapulted 20 to 30 feet into the air, according to the witness. A second eyewitness said the stolen car next sped at about 60 mph into a marsh. Four teens got out and started running as passersby asked if they were okay. They continued to flee. The MPD located two passengers: a 13-year-old boy and a 14-year-old boy. They complained of back pain and sought medical help. The MPD searched for the other passenger, and the car\u2019s driver, but they were able to successfully escape the dragnet. Madison firefighters extinguished the flames, and it took more than an hour to extract the stolen car, which was totaled, from the marsh.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

For good reason, he just had his apartment door kicked in by a stranger who had followed the victim home from the North Transfer Point, 1213 Huxley St. Along the route, the suspect repeatedly asked for money. The victim kept telling him to go away, but the persistent panhandler ignored pleas and continued to tag along. When they got to the victim\u2019s apartment, the man wanted to come inside. Now very concerned, the victim was able to lock the door, and keep the suspect out. That\u2019s when the door was kicked it in. As police were called, the would-be intruder fled. Thanks to a very good description provided by the victim, officers spotted George R. Staisil, age 37, no permanent address, in the 1900 block of Manley St. Staisil took off running, but the MPD tracked him down. He struggled with officers, threatening to disarm one, and to injure others. He was taken to the Dane County Jail on tentative charges of burglary, disorderly conduct, criminal damage to property, resisting, battery or threat to law enforcement, and felony bail jumping.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

The impact sent a wheel of the stolen car flying, but its driver still accelerated, with sparks flying, going a short distance before he and a female passenger took off running. Concerned passersby could not catch him, but the passenger was tackled. She was held in place while police responded. Investigators determined she had been battered by the driver just prior to the crash. The woman was also taken to a hospital. She only knew the suspect&nbsp;by a nickname. There was evidence of drug use in the stolen car. It was taken during a Wisconsin Dells burglary on December 8th. The MPD is looking for information on the driver.

Maysack, age 36, was behind the wheel of a stolen car: one belonging to a food delivery driver, the other taken after it was left unlocked and unattended to warm up.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latest incident, officers were called to a parking lot in the 1800 block of S. Stoughton Rd. shortly after noon yesterday after a concerned woman watched as Maysack drove very slowly before slumping over the steering wheel. A Madison Fire Department paramedic was able to reach into the car, put it in park, and remove keys from the ignition. It had been stolen Sunday after its owner left it warming up in a Hayes Rd. parking lot.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 9th, around 5:50 p.m., an off-duty Madison Police lieutenant spotted another stolen car, with headlights off, driving in and out of a ditch, and also in the wrong lanes of traffic on both County Highways T and TT. The lieutenant estimated speeds of up to 70 mph. Dane County Sheriff\u2019s deputies and Wisconsin State Troopers were able to box in the stolen car near the intersection of County Highway TT and County Highway N.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maysack was arrested following a high-risk stop. The car he was operating had been stolen earlier that day after a food delivery driver left it unlocked and running outside of a N. Livingston St. (Madison) address for about 30 seconds.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days earlier, on the afternoon of December 7th, an elderly woman told police a heavily damaged car nearly struck her as the driver drove in the wrong lane of traffic on Segoe Rd., near Sawyer Terrace.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another witness said the car was throwing sparks. One tire was gone, another was flat, and both bumpers were loose and damaged.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver, who turned out to be Maysack, soon abandoned the car and walked off. Officers located him at a bus stop and made the arrest.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",
